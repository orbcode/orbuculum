# 2.25Mbps, don't use TPIU, don't use Manchester encoding
# 72000000 is the current speed of the clock which the
# divisors are based on...hence the reason it's needed
# Be careful to not try to read the clock speed from the target
# (e.g. by using SystemCoreClock or similar) unless you've got the
# clock running at full speed at the time when this routine is called.
